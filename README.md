# empe-nudle-web
Modern one-page website made with Bootstrap CSS, HTML, Java in the back-end and Spring.

I started this project in August, in two weeks created and deployed on Heroku, 
including learning about html and css again, after a very long time ;-)

This is a public version of repo for code view only. 

The main purpose of this project was of course a good looking functional website and for me, to learn about Spring Framework.
I implemented the form back-end logic with the help of Thymeleaf,
Form information is send through mail service to the shop owner with the help of Spring Mailer API.
He will recieve a pre-set email template with all the info from a form, 
including email address to contact potential customer.
